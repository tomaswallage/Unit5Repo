            <p>I believe my practice exists as the intersection of my personal interests. It’s an extension and combination of my passions outside of ‘Graphic Design’ itself that influence how I perceive the world around me and how I design for it. My practice is heavily contextualised however not just from graphic-practitioners but from a wide range of sources across disciplines (I almost find it more common that my inspirations are external to design). Therefore, this essay will talk not only about 
                <span class="hover-word" data-image="meme1.jpg">Graphic Design</span>, but about music and soundscapes, technologies and systems and even pubs and bars. Research, process and experiments from my Unit 6 work will be used to support throughout.</p>
