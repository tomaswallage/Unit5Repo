            <p>The discussion around Post-digital Print is large in the design industry, Digital versus Print! Alessandro Ludovico talks in Post-Digital Print of a hypothetical “ideally balanced publishing ‘nirvana’, where pixels and paper live together in a perfect symbiosis” (Ludovico, 2012). Underground music scenes across the world lead by example here, well not necessarily always ‘print’ exactly but there is a special emphasis put on physical material that keeps the traditions of music pressing onto tapes, CDs and Vinyl. For example, in the UK, Independent Music Specialist Boomkat supplies the country with physical (and Digital) music material in genres ranging from Dub Techno and Deconstructed Club to Shoegaze and Indie Pop. </p>
            <p>This especially influences my work and the balance between digital and print/physical because with an interest in electronic music – a very forward-thinking genre – it’s helpful to see the importance of still valuing older physical methods. In my practice I like to try not to get carried away in the digital world (though it can be easy to), often I find what works for me is to develop, experiment throughout the project in mainly digital mediums and then introduce/mix some physical processes into the project. In unit 6, this was quite literal as I worked with digital Hardware to create the music and then recorded it onto tape as a more tactile way of communicating the work. For a better example, during the ‘Print Brief’ In Stage 1, I coded a Programme that generated Visual Compositions from an image given as an input, I then selected one of these outcomes and screen-printed it with some Lino-cut printed symbols layered on top.</p>
